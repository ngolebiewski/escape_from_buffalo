#Escape From Buffalo
##A text based game written in Python
##You're in Buffalo, New York, Zombies attack, can you escape?

I wrote this game when first seriously learning Python in March/April 2023. 
It works.
There are many things I learned.
There are many things I would do differently now (and may return to some day)

Issues
- I din't know that functions are meant to return something
- So many global variables!

To do
- Rewrite with object-oriented programming
- Add a high-score feature
- Add graphics
