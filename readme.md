# Escape From Buffalo
## A text based game written in Python
## You're in Buffalo, New York, Zombies attack, can you escape?

I wrote this game when first seriously learning Python in March/April 2023. 
A prompt from "Learn Python the Hard Way" - Zed Shaw

It works.

There are many things I learned and figured out while writing this program.
Also, there are many things I didn't know, such as:
- I din't know that functions are meant to return something
- So many global variables! Global variables are *BAD*!

To do
- Rewrite with object-oriented programming
- Add a high-score feature
- Add graphics
